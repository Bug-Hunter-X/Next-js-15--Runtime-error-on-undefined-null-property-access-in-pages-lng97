# Next.js 15 Runtime Error on Undefined/Null Property Access

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications when accessing undefined or null properties. The error occurs when a component attempts to access a property of a variable that hasn't been initialized or is null, resulting in a runtime error.  Standard Next.js error boundaries may not always catch this error leading to a full application crash.

## Problem

Next.js 15's improved error handling can sometimes mask deeper issues resulting in unexpected runtime crashes. When dealing with dynamic data fetched from APIs or complex component interactions, there is a higher chance of encountering null or undefined values. Directly accessing properties of these values leads to runtime errors.

## Solution

The most robust solution is to perform explicit null and undefined checks before attempting to access any properties.  Employing optional chaining or nullish coalescing operators significantly improves the code's resilience against such scenarios.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to `/about`. Observe the error.
5. Examine `bugSolution.js` to see the corrected implementation.
